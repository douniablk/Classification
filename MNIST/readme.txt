why we should shuffle the data?
some learning algorithms are sensitive to the order of the training  instances, 
and they perform poorly if they get many similar instances in a row. 
Shuffling the dataset ensures that this wonâ€™t happen
NB: Shuffling may be a bad idea in some contexts for ex if we're working on time series data (such as  stock market prices or weather conditions).
